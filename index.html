      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough

    <h2>When did croissants arrive in New York? </h2>
    <p>Croissants arrived in New York City in the early 20th century, gaining popularity in the 1920s as French pastries and cuisine became fashionable. American bakeries began producing croissants, and they became particularly popular with the city's growing middle class. While the modern croissant is often associated with France, its origins trace back to Austria, with the kipferl, a crescent-shaped bread or biscuit. August Zang, an Austrian baker, introduced Viennese pastries, including the kipferl, to Paris in the 19th century, where French bakers refined the recipe and technique, leading to the modern croissant. </p>
    <h2>The global rise of croissants</h2>
    <p>The croissant's popularity grew globally, with various adaptations and innovations occurring over time, including the rise of mass-produced, frozen croissants and even unique variations like the cronut.
